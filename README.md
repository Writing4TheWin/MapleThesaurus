# Introduction

Given how old Maplestory is, this game has gotten vastly more complicated over the years. Often when players read guides, talking to guildies, and chatting with other Maplers on Discord or Reddit, there are tons of in game jargons that make a newer player diffcult to comprehend. This serves as a simple guide for new and returning players to look up relevant Maple terms and abbreviations.
